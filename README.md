# Teste Desenvolvedor Fullstack (PHP) - Projeto EletroAPI

This is a project developed by **[Williamsena13](https://williamsena13.github.io)** that consists of a Fullstack application using the Laravel 10 framework for the Backend and VueJS for the Frontend. The goal is to create a small API for household appliances, allowing the creation, listing, editing, and removal of records, along with a frontend application to interact with this API.

## Backend

### Technical Requirements

- Programming Language: PHP 8.1 or higher
- Framework: Laravel 10
- Database: Relational (of your choice)

### Features

The API should provide the following functionalities:

- Creating a new household appliance with the following fields:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Voltage
  - Brand
- Listing registered household appliances.
- Editing an existing household appliance.
- Removing a household appliance.

### Configuration and Usage

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/williamsena13/api-household-appliances
   ```
````

2. Install Laravel dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Configure your database information in the `.env` file.

4. Run migrations to create the necessary database tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. Seed the database with test data:

   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

6. Start the local server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

7. Access the API via `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the Laravel application in a production environment, follow the steps below:

1. Production Environment Setup

   Ensure that the production server meets the technical requirements mentioned earlier, including PHP version and other dependencies.

2. Environment Configuration

   - Set up the `.env` file on the production server with the database connection information and other specific configurations.
   - Make sure to set the `APP_ENV` variable to `production` in the `.env` file.

3. Application Deployment

   - Upload the Laravel application files to the production server, typically using `git` or a secure file transfer method.
   - Configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to point to the `public` directory of the Laravel project.

4. Update Dependencies

   - Access the application directory on the server and run `composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev` to install dependencies and optimize the autoloader.

5. Generate Encryption Key

   - Run `php artisan key:generate` on the server to generate a new encryption key for the application.

6. Cache and Optimizations

   - Run `php artisan config:cache` and `php artisan route:cache` to optimize configuration and route caching.
   - Run `php artisan optimize` for further optimizations.

7. Web Server Configuration

   - Configure the web server to direct requests to the Laravel application. Make sure to set up rewrite rules correctly (e.g., `.htaccess` on Apache).

8. SSL (Optional, but recommended)

   - Set up SSL on the production server to ensure communication security.

9. Access the Application

   - Access the application via the server's domain or IP address.
